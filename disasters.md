# Learning from disasters

We can learn so much from past mistakes - this is a huge part of engineering education 

Chapter 16 of Fundamentals of Software Architecture conducts an autopsy on the Orchestration-Driven Service-Oriented Architecture style, describing it as 
"a logical but ultimately disastrous organizational philosophy, doomed ... to irrelevance" but also "a great example of how a particular organizational idea
can make logical sense yet hinder most important parts of the development process". I feel like I learned as much by reading this chapter as I did from the 
subequenet one on Microservices.
